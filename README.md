Fascinated by the varieties of sorting algorithms and insired by Clement Mihailescu's project idea, I decided to build a visualization tool for many common sorting algorithms including the following
- Merge Sort 
- Quick Sort 
- Bubble Sort 
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

You can access this visualizer using this link: ............

Features to be implemted: 
- Allow the user to choose how many bars they want (i.e., the length of the array)
- Allow the uswer to stop any program that is currently running 
- Add some explanations to each sort algorithm
- Include some other sorting algorithms such as heap sort

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
