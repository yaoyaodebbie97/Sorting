Fascinated by the varieties of sorting algorithms and insired by Clement Mihailescu's project idea, I decided to build a visualization tool for many common sorting algorithms including the following
- Merge Sort 
- Quick Sort 
- Bubble Sort 
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

You can access this visualizer using this link:  https://yaoyaodebbie97.github.io/sorting-visualizer/

Features to be implemted: 
- Allow the user to choose how many bars they want (i.e., the length of the array)
- Allow the uswer to stop any program that is currently running 
- Add some explanations to each sort algorithm
- Include some other sorting algorithms such as heap sort
